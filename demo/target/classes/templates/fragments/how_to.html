			<h2 id="controls">Basic Controls</h2>
			<p>In order to move you can use the keys W, A, S, and D to move Up, Left, Down, and Right respectively. These motions are relative to the screen,
			so Up is heading up the screen.</p>
			<p>In order to be good at this game, you will also probably need to know how to shoot. To select a weapon you can
			use number keys 1 through 4 to change your currently equipped weapon. You will not always have multiple weapons, so make sure to pay attention to
			your HUD (heads-up display) to tell which weapons are available and which is equipped. To aim your weapon, you move your mouse towards where you want to shoot and 
			then click with the left mouse button to fire. Some weapons take time/preparation to fire.</p>
			<p>In most game modes and maps, what you can see on the screen at the start of the game is not the entire map. As you move your player around,
			the camera will pan to follow you, allowing you to see new parts of the map.</p>
			<p>Some maps are very large and some are very small. Because of this, some players will want to change the amount of the map that
			they can see at one time. Pressing 'Z' on the keyboard will toggle which level of zoom the camera is currently at.</p>
			
			<br>
			<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay Concepts</h2>
			<p>Simply understanding the controls of the game isn't enough to win a game. You also have to understand the general flow of the game
			and have just a bit of strategy. The main focus of CyCap is a game mode called "Capture the Flag". If you haven't heard of it before,
			the goal is to cross the map into enemy territory and grab their flag while keeping the enemy from stealing your flag. After picking up a flag, you 
			have to run it back to your base before someone from the other team catches you. Sounds easy, right?</p>
			<p>If the game were that easy, it probably wouldn't be all that much fun. A few aspects of CyCap make it a bit more challenging. First off, if you have grabbed
			the flag and someone from the other team currently has your team's flag, you cannot capture the enemy flag until your's has been returned. Secondly, you can't
			always see where the enemy is at, they only show up on your screen when they are close enough for you to detect. There are certain exceptions to this rule. Third, there are different
			roles or "classes" that you can select at the beginning of the game. You can read more about <a href="#classes">classes</a> and their abilities 
			later in the tutorial. For now though, know that each of these classes has a unique ability that gives additional stratagetic options. Additionally, on some maps
			and in some game modes, there are power-ups scattered around the map which can gives players a boost to speed, health, or damage.</p>
			
			<br>
			<h2 id="classes">Classes</h2>
			<p>After completing the first 3 challenges associated with the Recruit class, you immediately unlock 3 more classes: Artillery, Infantry and Scout.
			Each of those three classes unlocks additional classes, such as Sniper or Demolitionist. All classes except for the Recruit class have a unique
			special ability that can only be used a certain number of times per round. For example, the Artillery class has a special attack that allows
			them to shoot mortars over walls. This attack also has some drawbacks such as a reduced attack range and slower bullet travel.</p>
